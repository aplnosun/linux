/*
 * GCC stack protector support.
 *
 * Stack protector works by putting predefined pattern at the start of
 * the stack frame and verifying that it hasn't been overwritten when
 * returning from the function.  The pattern is called stack canary
 * and gcc expects it to be defined by a global variable called
 * "__stack_chk_guard" on ARM.  This unfortunately means that on SMP
 * we cannot have a different canary value per task.
